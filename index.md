## Vision

**I am here to change the world by empowering myself and others.**

**I am here to end self esteem issues, limiting beliefs, feelings of being unloved/unsupported,** and to facilitate self love and self assurance so you know you **are** loved, you **are** important, **you** have a place in this world, and you **are** needed.

I know that we can have **a world where each and every person is empowered to fulfil their life purpose, and we are dancing together in love, peace and harmony.**

It is a travesty and an outrage that ...innocent children suffer.
**Children deserve to be valued, respected, loved, cherished, safe and protected from all harm.**

They **deserve** to have every opportunity to shine, to discover and share their gifts and talents, and to try new things, just for the fun of it; **to love and be loved for all eternity.**

I am taking this stand because **I have had low self-esteem all my life,** from birth, even though I was "successful" in many areas. **No matter how hard I worked, or what I did, I wasn't enough. I was rejected, cheated on. I didn't feel loved or supported. I was disconnected. I was a victim.
I took on the pain of Humanity because I was so sensitive.**

Through learning to help myself, **I am able to help others help themselves.** Because my pain started in childhood, I work with children, teens and the inner child of adults. Unless you release the suppressed emotions of childhood and beyond, you carry the pain through the rest of your life. It is never too late to change your life!

You don't need to feel bad or less than any more. **You deserve to be happy, free, creative, unjudged, listened to, seen, heard, respected. You deserve to feel worthy, to feel equal, not less than.** You deserve to enjoy your life as a child so you can grow up to be a confident, caring, contributing, connected person in this world - one with true equal opportunities, who can thrive and survive independently in all aspects, who can enjoy loving, connected relationships and enjoy/revel in the beauty of nature and abundance for all.

**The world could be experiencing...
Fun, freedom, passion, excitement, a zest for learning, trying new things, adventure, opportunities...A world where there is no wrong, only experiences.** And these experiences marry together in unusual and magical ways to create new inventions, discoveries, opportunities and experiences.

**Instead ...
People are miserable, separated, judgemental,** warlike, us and them, must be a winner, fight to the end; where children should be "seen and not heard", kept in place, accessories, pander to your wishes and variances. There is no winner here.

**I want you to be happy, loved, fulfilled.** I want to help you to make a difference in your life, so you can help others do the same; just like the ripples in a pond radiate out when a stone is dropped in it.

**You have the power to choose:** to continue life as you know it; or to experience something different.

**I know what it's like to feel unseen, unheard, unloved, unacknowledged, unaccepted, unsupported, unsafe; to be scared, lonely, not trusting, not knowing what to do, nor how to do it; not seeing a way out of the current situation and limitations. I know what it's like to be in survival mode, depressed, lacking energy and motivation.**

**I have moved beyond all that. And you can too.**

I am here to inspire, support, accelerate and empower you in your transformation, providing a safe, loving, compassionate, nurturing space for you to release the past, love and forgive yourself, and allow a new life to unfold.

**Are you ready to be supported to create a more loving, joyful and fulfilling life?**

## Testimonials 

Sandy is an amazing coach.  She was able to quickly pick out what was causing me the most anguish in the moment and helped me to see the truth of what was causing it to show up and to feel it fully. In doing so, through a series of tools that I have never used before, she assisted me in opening up to the pain beneath the story.  I was able to clear the energy and it transformed how I am viewing the situation and gave me tools in case I started to dive back into that same space, how to get myself out of it and re-frame it.  Thank you, thank you. I am so grateful you were there for me.

My goodness, what can I say about Sandy?  I can say she is amazing!  Sandy helped me in a session to connect with my inner child and led me on an incredible healing journey.  I am
still sifting through the knowledge obtained during that time.  She has assisted me multiple times with her intuition and connection to source, helping me understand and move forward from things blocking my path to true joy.  If you can spend some time with this amazing woman, I highly recommend it!  She has become very dear to me, I am extremely grateful she came into my life.

Spiritually-led and spiritually-based facilitation, in alignment with both Spirit and my own inner being. Each step of the process, however it unfolds that day, resonates with me. Behind the gentle, caring and non-judgmental facilitation is such clarity and effective work. It's easy to follow what's happening. It's easy to implement what I am guided to do or be.

It's always on track from beginning to end. It's always on point with what is happening and with what is wanted. There is no rush and there is no dilly dallying. Step-by-step, the direction is clear and immediately resonates as the best path for me to take during the process. If I hesitate, Sandra knows which way to guide me and once I take that guided step, it works!

Often the steps Sandra recommends may be seemingly out of the box, but they are tuned to what I want or would do. In addition to having some of my deepest blocks (some of them held over a decade long) opened up and shifted in a very short period of time, I learned more about facilitation, just by observing how Sandra works with me/ her client.

You are so tuned into your client AND spirit. You have a tremendous gift.

Sandy is an amazing coach. I don't think there is anything that you are experiencing that she hasn't also gone through, in some way, at some point of her extremely varied and extraordinary life. She is deeply in tune with the present moment and the healing words and perspectives pour through her with such relevance and insight. She walks and talks kindness and generosity and to be in a session with her is an experience of trust, safety and containment. Working with Sandy brings the comfortable feeling of being with an old friend, but one who has a laser like insight into the situation at hand.

I am an emotional wellness coach on my own journey and I have been blessed to work with Sandy Grant.  I have been life coaching for many years but finally decided to start charging for my services. I had no idea I had so many blocks around money and being seen and heard. No wonder I never started my own business!  I had no idea I did not feel worthy enough to have my “own” money. Over the past 9 to 10 months Sandy has brought into my awareness the blocks and fears for making money, being seen, being heard, feelings of unworthiness and a multitude of other areas of my life I was holding back.

I can see where my clients need help but I couldn’t see my own blocks. I am so thankful I said yes when I heard my intuition to contact Sandy. I have been amazed and so thankful our time zones (I am in Alaska, USA) or distance have never been a problem.

Her talents include an awareness of the core pattern (issue) ready to be released and the ability to root it out with skill and precision. Her laser beam accuracy is the reason I’ve continued to work  with her for almost a year.

I would highly recommend Sandy for anyone who is ready to face their emotional patterns that are ready to be delicately rooted out and released. Sandy is highly intuitive and has been a powerful healer to my broken heart. I see love in all I am and do.  Since working with Sandy I have been a speaker on stage, promoted myself at a woman’s show, have developed my own healing events, and started my own emotional wellness practice without fear to make money!  I feel like a billion bucks!!! Thank you Sandy!

I worked with Sandy a few days ago and wow! Sandy helped me see my age old limiting beliefs and showed me how to let them go. I’m actually feeling lighter and freer.  When she finished helping me let go of emotional baggage, she then gave me practical steps to make different choices. The new practical choices are to clear my throat chakra and give me a voice. I’ve been struggling with physical symptoms in my throat for about six months. My throat is already feeling so much better.  Thank you Sandy for seeing and empowering me!

Sandy has made me feel listened to, seen, unconditionally loved and supported in ways that definitely opened new paths in my life. She lives in a vibration that heals by empowering any soul. Being coached by Sandy has been one the deepest enlightening experiences I have ever had.

Our coaching session was intense. I have printed the notes you took and read them every day. Whenever I catch myself "playing small" I tell myself " but what about infinite possibilities?" "I wonder what this magic universe has in store for me today". Nice experience. I am also aware of acknowledging my anger and my sadness. I think these are the feelings I have been suppressing since I was a little girl. The most interesting experience I have had since our coaching is feeling that those feelings --I have been most afraid of- are not mine. and I feel a space between myself and the feeling every time I acknowledge it. Thank you!

I also feel a higher vibration and feel inspired to go beyond. Last night I had a dream. I was on a beach with someone and there were huge frightening waves but I wasn't afraid. I was like playing to reach the top of every wave which went many metres above the ground and then I happened to be on the shore safe and sound and prepared to move to the top of the next wave again and again.

I am also doing the exercise of unplugging the cords.I need to continue with it. It is like having a program to work on every day.

Thank you to Sandy for an amazing healing session. This loving healing process truly opened my eyes as to my behaviour & connections in this lifetime. Things now make so much sense. Sandy facilitated me in releasing deeply embedded pain, grief, fear & anger.
What a cathartic release it was! Not only did it provide instant relief, but created a ripple effect of healing to follow.
Throughout the entire process, I felt safe & reassured. Sandy knew exactly the right thing to say at the right time.
Sandy you are an amazing healer with both the gift of insight & compassion. You are a gift to the world!!!
Many thanks

Sandra is a wonderfully focused facilitator in the Life Transformation sessions we have done together. At times I wander off on a tangent away from the initial target energy, but she will notice this and bring me gently back to square, after dealing with any ramifications. I would warmly recommend her to anyone who is considering letting go of their "stuff" and releasing it into Love.

Sandy demonstrated her presence in the moment of her true self on stage in Sedona. She was completely vulnerable in her extreme journey from child to adult life, and is able to transmit her real self to helping others now across the spectrum of humanity. I am honoured to knowing her through the transformative work she has helped me through, and recommend her services to one and all. 

This came to me - When you "rock" during your phone processing facilitations, you are transmitting the energetic for nullifying "fight or flight", so that your clients can relax into diving deeply within to see/find their issues.

I have had the pleasure of having sessions with Sandy. Sandy has amazing intuition and used it to assist me during my sessions. I love how Sandy connects so easily and naturally to children. This also includes the inner child. Sandy has worked with my inner child and has helped my little one release energy that was stuck doing fun things. Sandy is beautiful, amazing and very authentic in what she offers in her sessions. Sandy makes me feel safe and reassured during each of my sessions with her. I highly recommend Sandy to everyone!

What an incredible, heart opening speech.  Sandra so beautifully used words to transport me on a journey to love.  Even the space between her words magnetically pulled me into my own sacred heart.  So grateful.
