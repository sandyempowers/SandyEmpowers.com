**Are you ready to be supported to create a more loving, joyful and fulfilling life?**

![Life Coach](lifecoach.png)

**I am here to change the world by empowering myself and others.**

**I am here to end self esteem issues, limiting beliefs, feelings of being unloved/unsupported,** and to facilitate self love and self assurance so you know you **are** loved, you **are** important, **you** have a place in this world, and you **are** needed.

I know that we can have **a world where each and every person is empowered to fulfil their life purpose, and we are dancing together in love, peace and harmony.**

It is a travesty and an outrage that ...innocent children suffer.
**Children deserve to be valued, respected, loved, cherished, safe and protected from all harm.**

They **deserve** to have every opportunity to shine, to discover and share their gifts and talents, and to try new things, just for the fun of it; **to love and be loved for all eternity.**

I am taking this stand because **I have had low self-esteem all my life,** from birth, even though I was "successful" in many areas. **No matter how hard I worked, or what I did, I wasn't enough. I was rejected, cheated on. I didn't feel loved or supported. I was disconnected. I was a victim.
I took on the pain of Humanity because I was so sensitive.**

Through learning to help myself, **I am able to help others help themselves.** Because my pain started in childhood, I work with children, teens and the inner child of adults. Unless you release the suppressed emotions of childhood and beyond, you carry the pain through the rest of your life. It is never too late to change your life!

You don't need to feel bad or less than any more. **You deserve to be happy, free, creative, unjudged, listened to, seen, heard, respected. You deserve to feel worthy, to feel equal, not less than.** You deserve to enjoy your life as a child so you can grow up to be a confident, caring, contributing, connected person in this world - one with true equal opportunities, who can thrive and survive independently in all aspects, who can enjoy loving, connected relationships and enjoy/revel in the beauty of nature and abundance for all.

**The world could be experiencing...
Fun, freedom, passion, excitement, a zest for learning, trying new things, adventure, opportunities...A world where there is no wrong, only experiences.** And these experiences marry together in unusual and magical ways to create new inventions, discoveries, opportunities and experiences.

**Instead ...
People are miserable, separated, judgemental,** warlike, us and them, must be a winner, fight to the end; where children should be "seen and not heard", kept in place, accessories, pander to your wishes and variances. There is no winner here.

**I want you to be happy, loved, fulfilled.** I want to help you to make a difference in your life, so you can help others do the same; just like the ripples in a pond radiate out when a stone is dropped in it.

**You have the power to choose:** to continue life as you know it; or to experience something different.

**I know what it's like to feel unseen, unheard, unloved, unacknowledged, unaccepted, unsupported, unsafe; to be scared, lonely, not trusting, not knowing what to do, nor how to do it; not seeing a way out of the current situation and limitations. I know what it's like to be in survival mode, depressed, lacking energy and motivation.**

**I have moved beyond all that. And you can too.**

I am here to inspire, support, accelerate and empower you in your transformation, providing a safe, loving, compassionate, nurturing space for you to release the past, love and forgive yourself, and allow a new life to unfold.

**Are you ready to be supported to create a more loving, joyful and fulfilling life?**

## Testimonials 

Sandy is an amazing coach.  She was able to quickly pick out what was causing me the most anguish in the moment and helped me to see the truth of what was causing it to show up and to feel it fully. In doing so, through a series of tools that I have never used before, she assisted me in opening up to the pain beneath the story.  I was able to clear the energy and it transformed how I am viewing the situation and gave me tools in case I started to dive back into that same space, how to get myself out of it and re-frame it.  Thank you, thank you. I am so grateful you were there for me.

Sandy demonstrated her presence in the moment of her true self on stage in Sedona. She was completely vulnerable in her extreme journey from child to adult life, and is able to transmit her real self to helping others now across the spectrum of humanity. I am honoured to knowing her through the transformative work she has helped me through, and recommend her services to one and all. 
This came to me - When you "rock" during your phone processing facilitations, you are transmitting the energetic for nullifying "fight or flight", so that your clients can relax into diving deeply within to see/find their issues.

I have had the pleasure of having sessions with Sandy. Sandy has amazing intuition and used it to assist me during my sessions. I love how Sandy connects so easily and naturally to children. This also includes the inner child. Sandy has worked with my inner child and has helped my little one release energy that was stuck doing fun things. Sandy is beautiful, amazing and very authentic in what she offers in her sessions. Sandy makes me feel safe and reassured during each of my sessions with her. I highly recommend Sandy to everyone!
